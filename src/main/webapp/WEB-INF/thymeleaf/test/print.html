<br/>
<h2>Section I - Degrees</h2>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Requirements</b>
<br/>
The requirements for all degrees are to be found in the University Catalog. Degree candidates are subject to the degree requirements of the class
<br/>
year to which they are assigned at the time of their admission, or readmission, to the degree program.
<br/>
<b>
<br/>
3. Two Degree Programs
</b>
<br/>
Well qualified students may elect to fulfill the requirements of the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science or two Bachelor of Science degrees in
<br/>
a program directed toward two degrees subject to the approval of the departments or schools concerned. Two degrees may take more than four
<br/>
years to complete.
<br/>
<b>
<br/>
4. Conferring of Degrees (Graduation)
</b>
<br/>
a. The faculty, through the Committee on Academic Standings and Degrees (CASD), shall recommend to the President students who have
<br/>
completed degree requirements.
<br/>
b. No degree shall be conferred or diploma awarded until the Registrar’s Office determines that all degree requirements are met.
<br/>
c. No degree shall be conferred or diploma awarded until the recipient has paid all University bills or arranged for payment to the satisfaction of
<br/>
the Chief Financial Officer.
<br/>
d. No undergraduate degree shall be conferred or diploma awarded until the Vice President for Student Affairs and Commandant has cleared
<br/>
the student’s record.
<br/>
e. Only those undergraduate students who have met graduation requirements, or are in good standing and enrolled in courses, after the
<br/>
withdrawal date in the spring semester, that could complete graduation requirements will be allowed to participate in the graduation
<br/>
exercises. Enrollment in summer courses does not satisfy this requirement.
<br/>
<h2>Section II - Credit, Courses and Curricula</h2>
<b>1. Award of Credit</b>
<br/>
a. Credit hours and grade points shall be awarded only for those University courses for which a student is properly registered.
<br/>
b. Credit hours, not grade points, for approved courses taken by a Norwich student at other accredited institutions may be transferred, subject
<br/>
to the residence requirement and provided grades earned are “C” or above, for credit toward a bachelor’s degree.
<br/>
c. Credit hours for extra institutional learning may be awarded in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3, following.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Credits for Graduation</b>
<br/>
a. Graduation requirements are measured in courses and credits. Courses and credits required for graduation are specified in the catalog for
<br/>
each curriculum. Students should consult the catalog to be sure they are meeting the graduation requirements in their major.
<br/>
b. A student will receive the equivalent of one three-credit course to fulfill published credit or course requirements as a free elective in a major or
<br/>
minor when three one-credit courses in the same discipline are combined. A student is limited to one such course. One-credit ROTC courses
<br/>
and courses numbered below 100 may not be used.
